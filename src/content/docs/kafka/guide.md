Scalability  opens  other  opportunities  too.  Single  clusters  can  grow  to  companyscales, without the risk of workloads overpowering the infrastructure. For exam‐ple,  New  Relic  relies  on  a  single  clusterof  around  100  nodes,  spanning  threedatacenters, and processing 30 GB/s. In other, less data-intensive domains, 5- to10-node clusters commonly support whole-company workloads. But it should benoted  that  not  all  companies  take  the  “one  big  cluster”  route.  Netflix,  for  exam‐ple, advises using several smaller clusters to reduce the operational overheads ofrunning  very  large  installations,  but  their  largest  installation  is  still  around  the200-node mark.
